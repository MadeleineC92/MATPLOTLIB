###**DATA VISUALIZATION – WEEK 5**

“In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.”

##**Data Summary**
*	The highest Tumour Volume rate was Ketapnl with a Max Volume rate of 78.56
*	Those with the max weight of 30 all returned high tumour volumes.
*	Ca[omulin and Ramicane both had the lower weight (g) for the study and returned lower tumour volumes which resulted in both being the better drug regimens. Future investigation should be conducted to test if the weight has anything to do with the tumour volumes.
